                <p class="answer">
                You should make an appointment at a California DMV office to obtain your learner's permit.  Once you obtain the permit you must obtain another certificate showing that you have completed the practical portion.  The practical portion typically consists of a 20 hour road course, on the road, in a car with a California approved DMV instructor.  Once you have completed that portion, you can take the California DMV Road Exam to obtain your drivers license.
                </p>
                <p class="question">
                Do you provide the practical portion?
                </p>
                <p class="answer">
                Caldrivers.com does not, we only provide the written exam.  However, you can request one of our affiliates to contact you.  You can then schedule the next part of your training with them.
